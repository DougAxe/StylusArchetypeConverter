Break down into vertices (moderately difficult)

For each vertice pair, try each stroke for best fit, use one that doesn't go outside the original image lines (for tie?).

Continue for all (avoid doing the reverses for pairs)

Weaknesses:
We are going to do alot of extra lines






take each border point, find closes border point which touches other side, mark midpoint. (extremely expensive)

Using stroke data find nearest matching stroke type (error of nearest point on both lines) (expensive, cheaper way?)

Stroke types can have bound box
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke_(CJK_character) (36 types)

Replace each messy stroke with the matching stroke.

Fit each stroke into place (manual, or automatic)
